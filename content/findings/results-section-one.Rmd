## Main Findings 

Dadashazar (2017) identified factors including previous incarceration, family relations, employment and education barriers, housing constraints and substance abuse to be associated with increased recidivism. 
Hanson (2017) concluded that prior criminal history and substance abuse were among the risk factors for multiple types of recidivism across multiple types of offenders.

###Recidivism
Our team initially began looking into recidivism in Page County and the rest of Virginia. However, recidivism and even substance abuse data are scarce. Focusing on the factors of recidivism mentioned by Dadashazar (2017) and Hanson (2017) we used the incarceration and substance abuse data to visualize and compare Page County to other counties in Virginia. 

The racing incarceration rates below show that incarceratin rates in Page County are relatively high compared to neighboring counties and even the state average.

Taking a closer look at the comparison of Page County incarceration rates to the average rates in Virinia, we can see that a large gap has developed since the early 2000's.

While the substance abuse arrest data may be indicative of many factors including law and law enforcement practices, the rural areas of Virginia can be seen to have higher substance abuse arrest rates. This may be indicative of growing substance abuse problems in rural areas which is supported by other studies in the literature (Pullen and Oser, 2014; Schoeneberger et al., 2006).

###Grant Search
In addition to these findings, potential resources including grant funding and recidivism programs can be found below:

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DT)

grants <- read.csv("Grants_Page.csv", header = T)
colnames(grants) <- c("Opportunity Name", "Agency Name", "Other Info", "Misc")
DT::datatable(grants, escape = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 7))

```
